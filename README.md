# Server-Protocol-Test

Client Server Protocol project is based on the protocol which will permit special gateway to be added to the existing internet without having manipulating the existing gateways.

Suppose a new gateway is to be added to the existing internet and this can be allocated to near by neighbors with which this gateway can communicate. 

The neighbors which are already inside group of the other working network have already send the routing information to other and themselves.

So then this gateway needs to inform all its neighbors about current nodes of network it could reach. 

So they can finally update their routing table and then propagate the routing information to the remaining gateways in the network.
